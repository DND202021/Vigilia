## Accumulated Context

### Pending Todos
1. `2025-01-31-project-status-review-action-items.md` - High-level action items from status review

### Key Decisions
- Phase 10 completed with 10 sprints covering all Building Information Management features
- Communication Hub deferred to Milestone 2.0 (Phase 12)
- Mobile app optional, prioritized after core platform stability

### Technical Debt
- Test coverage needs verification (target >85%)
- No production observability (Prometheus/Grafana)
- External integrations coded but not connected to real systems
